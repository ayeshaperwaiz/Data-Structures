insertAtFront
{
    This function inserts a node at the beginning of the list. 

    Its Big O notation is O(1) since it does not depend on the size of the list,
    rather it just replaces the start of the list.

    //O(1)
}

insertAtBack
{
    This functions inserts node at the end of the list. 

    Since there is 1 while loop that goes through every element in the object, the Big O notation would be
    O(1n) or just simply O(n). It is dependent on the number of elements in the list.

    //O(n)
}
